# GIS Maps

These 2 GIS maps are together the final project for the course NGN180 Geographical Information Systems - Introduction. For the maps, QGIS was mainly used to visualize course participant data across Sweden.  

For detailed project descriptions, check ``NGN180_FinalMap.pdf`` in the project files.  

The first map visualizes course participants' hometowns combined with a point cluster visualization across the entirety of Sweden. The map can be found at [``Map1/map1.pdf``](https://github.com/ruireng/gis-maps/blob/main/Map1/map1.pdf).
