# GIS Maps
These 2 GIS maps are together the final project for the course NGN180 Geographical Information Systems - Introduction. For the maps, QGIS was mainly used to visualize course participant data across Sweden.  

For detailed project descriptions, check [``NGN180_FinalMap.pdf``](https://github.com/ruireng/gis-maps/blob/main/NGN180_FinalMap.pdf) in the project files.  

The first map visualizes the course participants' hometowns combined with a point cluster visualization across the entirety of Sweden. The map can be found at [``Map1/map1.pdf``](https://github.com/ruireng/gis-maps/blob/main/Map1/map1.pdf).  

The second map visualizes the course participants' age, educational background, and favorite color in the Gothenburg region. The map can be found at [``Map2/map2.pdf``](https://github.com/ruireng/gis-maps/blob/main/Map2/map2.pdf).

## About this project:

This project was made during the summer of 2025.  
The software used for making the maps is QGIS. Both maps used base maps from QuickMapServices. For map 1, "Esri World Imagery" was used and for map 2, "ESRI" was used. The maps are produced in Swedish.
